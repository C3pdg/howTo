        <h2>Chess Peices</h2>
        <h3>Pawn</h3>
        <p>Pawn can only move one or two spaces on the first move. Then the pawn can only move one space each time. Pawn can only go in one direction and that is forward. Pawn can only take other peices if the peice the pawn is going to take is diagonal from the pawns possition.</p>
        <h3>Bishop</h3>
        <p> The Bishop can only move Diagonaly. The Bishop can move any direction but has to move in a diagnol line. The bishop can take peices if they are in the diagonal line the bishop is moving in.</p>
        <h3>The Knight</h3>
        <p>The knight can move in an L shape. The knight moves in a 2/1 ratio. Meaning if the knight were to move right, the knight would move two spaces right and one space up or down. The knight can take a peice if the peice is in the spot in which the knight would land.</p>
        <h3>The Rook</h3>
        <p>The Rook looks like a castle. The rook can move in any direction going, up, down, left, or right. The rook cannot move diagonaly. The rook will take a peice if the rook ends in the spot in which the peice is.</p>
        <h3>The Queen</h3>  
        <p> The queen can move in any direction up, down, right, left, or diagonal. The queen is the most powerful peice on the board. The queen takes any peice in which it ends on.</p>
        <h3>The King</h3>
        <p>The King can only move one space in any direction left, right, up, down, diagonal. If a peice is able to possibly take the king, meaning for example a Bishop is diagonal from the king. The King would either have to move or put another peice in front of it. You lose when your king is taken meaning you cant move in any way to protect your king. This is called checkmate.</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.</p>
        
        <h3>Board Setup</h3>
        <p>The game is played on an 8x8 square board with alternating light and dark squares. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns. The back row is set up with rooks in the corners, followed by knights, then bishops, queen, and king. The queen is on her own color, for example if I was white my queen would be on the which square. The pawns are in the row directly in front of all the other pieces.</p>
        
        <h3>Special Moves</h3>
        <h4>Castling:</h4>
        <p>A move that allows the king and a rook to move simultaneously. The king moves two squares towards the rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king. Conditions: Neither piece has moved before, there are no pieces between them, and the king is not in check.</p>
        <h4>En Passant:</h4>
        <p>A special pawn capture that can occur if a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn. The opponent can capture it as if it moved only one square forward.</p>
        <h4>Promotion</h4>
        <p>When a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king), usually a queen.</p>
        
        <h3>Check and Checkmate</h3>
        <h4>Check:</h4>
        <p>When a king is under threat of capture. The player must make a move to remove the check (by moving the king, capturing the threatening piece, or blocking the attack).</p>
        <h4>Checkmate:</h4>
        <p>When a king is in check and has no legal moves to escape. This ends the game.</p>
        
        <h3>Draw Conditions</h3>
        <h4>Stalemate:</h4>
        <p>A player has no legal moves and is not in check.</p>
        <h4>Insufficient Material:</h4>
        <p>Neither player has enough pieces to force a checkmate.</p>
        <h4>Threefold Repetition:</h4>
        <p>The same position occurs three times with the same player to move.</p>
        <h4>Fifty-move rule:</h4>
        <p>If 50 Consecutive moves are made by both players without any pawn movement or piece capture.</p>

        <h3>Turns</h3>
        <p>Players Alternate turns, moving one piece at a time.</p>

        <h3>Touch-Move Rule</h3>
        <p>If a player touches a piece, they must move it if it's legal to do so. If they touch an opponentâ€™s piece, they must capture it if possible.</p>
